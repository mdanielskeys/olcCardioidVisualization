# olcCardioidVisualization
A version of The Coding Train challenge #133 using the olcPixelGameEngine

## Compilation
Compiled in Visual Studio 2022, but should work with Linux or Mac g++ with C++17 support. You will need the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine). 
Follow the instructions for other platforms in the olcPixelGameEngine wiki.

## Reference and Story
This is an implementation of a "Coding Challenge" for the YouTube channel The Coding Train. [Coding Challenge #133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl3nc_a1nvs).
The author is using Processing with the code, but I've been relearning C++. This is a fun way to get reacquanted with the language in my opinion.

Of course there is a license to follow for the olcPixelGameEngine
